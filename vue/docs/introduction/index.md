::: tip Hi there!!👋🏻
First of all, thanks for visiting our book and taking an interest in Visual Programming using Grasshopper. Before we get started with the technical _(and fun 🎉)_ stuff, allow us to go through a little introduction.

## About this book

This book was written by [Paramdigma](https://paramdigma.com), a computational geometry collective based in Barcelona. It is released under a combination of MIT and CreativeCommons license _(book contents are CC, all code and gh files shared under MIT)_

This is a collaborative effort that you, as a reader, are **more than welcome** to take part of. We welcome all contributions, no matter how small. We organize all work through it's own [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/paramdigma/messy-wires), so feel free to open an issue to correct anything, or create a Pull Request if you feel like we missed something!

## Who is this book for ❔

**_Messy Wires_** is a book that centers around the concept of creating understandable adn mantainable visual programming scripts using Grasshopper. It is intended as a general introduction to already established best-practices in the coding world; therefore, we will asume that you already know the basics of how Grasshopper works, you are familiar with most of Grasshopper's default components and are comfortable creating medium sized scripts.

### ...is it focused on any specific design field ❔

Our aim is to make this book as _Grasshopper generic_ as possible, meaning it will not be focused on a specific design or engineering background. That being said, all of the Paramdigma team are **architects** and **building engineers**, so you might see a little influence of that in some of our examples 😅.

### 🤔...ok, this is not me ❕

If you are getting started with Grasshopper, that is ok! We've all been there. There are already many good introduction books and courses out there, their authors have done an amazing job and we didn't think it was worth repeating the same information. Check below a list of usefull Grasshopper resources
