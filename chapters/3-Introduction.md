# Nodes

Visual programming software, such as Grasshopper, is amost always based on the concept of ***nodes***, wich can be connected in a chain like manner to create complex interactions between them.

Consider the following grasshopper nodes:

:::{#fig:ghComponents}

![Inputless component](){#fig:Code1}
![Outputless component](){#fig:Code2}
![Component with input and output](){#fig:Code3}

:::

Grasshopper components can have any number of inputs and outputs, including none, as can be seen in [@fig:ghComponents].
