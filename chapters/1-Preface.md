# Introduction

<!-- Este capÃ­tulo lo veo mÃ¡s como un PROLOGO (como una combinaciÃ³n entre Stage of the art + Abstract)-->

During the last 10 years, visual programming tools have become mainstream in many industries, transforming the way we design in the process.
This new tools allow architects and designers to create unprecedented designs, introducing unique features that have become the trademark image of many successfull architects.

However, these added capabilities usually come at a price: these higher level programming environments are the result of bringing coding concepts into the design space and, as such, benefitting from them requires a broad understanding of the underlying logic these programs follow.

In this book, we will cover some of this concepts using Rhinoceros Grasshopper, a very popular visual programming software, that is widely used in many industries.

It's title, _Messy Wires_, makes allusion to one of the main problems when creating successfull visual programming scripts at a professional level: _code clarity_, wich we will explain in more detail in [INSERT_REFERENCE].

We will start by understanding Grasshopper _Data Trees_, explaining the logic behind how they work, and how to properlly use them to introduce complexity in our designs while at keeping the size of our scripts manageable.

We will also cover some visual programming good practices, such as grouping, naming conventions, structuring and ordering scripts and some concepts directly inherited from programing, such as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

## How to use this book

This book contains multiple example files, that will be uploaded at the books own GitHub Repository.

Througout the book, you will find BIDI codes that will link to the apropriate files for each section.

Since we will be using Grasshopper as our main tool, most of the files will be saved in `.ghx` format, which is 'friendlier' to 'git', the version control software we use (and love!).

## Who is this book aimed for

This book is aimed at designers, engineers, architects and any other design professionals who are already familiar with the basic use of Grasshopper but want to be able to use it proficiently on their daily workflow.

If you are not familiar with the use of Grasshopper as a design tool, we recommend you to check out this incredible resources:
